# Dotfiles

This is [my](https://git.bei3.net/dirkr) dotfiles configuration.

The repo contains the base configuration (zsh, vim, tmux, ...) needed for
"every" user account I use.
It is based on the [dfm](https://github.com/justone/dfm) utility to help
with managing and updating my dotfiles.

## Using these dotfiles

Just clone this repo and run the installer to deploy the dotfiles onto a new
system:

    $ git clone https://git.bei3.net/dirkr/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    $ ~/.dotfiles/bin/dfm install

You can also run <tt>dfm --help</tt>.
